# Resume Prompt

## Quick Context
Reddit AI Automod is a Devvit-based **user profiling & analysis system** that uses AI (Claude 3.5 Haiku or OpenAI gpt-4o-mini) to detect problematic posters: romance scammers, dating seekers, underage users, and spammers. Built with TypeScript, Redis storage, trust scoring, and strict cost controls.

**Stack**: Reddit Devvit (TypeScript), Redis, AI (Claude/OpenAI/DeepSeek)
**AI Providers**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (primary), OpenAI gpt-4o-mini (fallback), DeepSeek V3 (testing)
**Current Phase**: Phase 3 - Rules Engine & Actions (Ready to Start)
**Phase 1 Status**: COMPLETE ✅
**Phase 2 Status**: COMPLETE ✅
**Target Subs**: r/FriendsOver40, r/FriendsOver50, r/bitcointaxes

---

## ⚠️ Major Architecture Change - 2025-10-25

**Original Plan**: Generic rule engine with 20 predetermined rules
**New Direction**: User profiling system analyzing new posters

**Why the change**: Actual use case is detecting specific user types (scammers, dating seekers, underage) in FriendsOver40/50 subs, not generic content moderation.

---

## What's Next

### Immediate (Phase 3 - Rules Engine & Actions Integration)

**Priority 1: Integration**
1. **Wire AI Analyzer into PostSubmit handler**
   - Call AIAnalyzer.analyzeUser() for non-trusted users
   - Handle budget exhausted scenarios
   - Handle provider unavailable scenarios
   - Log all AI analyses with correlation IDs

2. **Configure API Keys via Devvit Settings**
   - Add Anthropic API key setting
   - Add OpenAI API key setting
   - Add DeepSeek API key setting
   - Document setup process for moderators

**Priority 2: Rules Engine**
3. **Create Rules Engine** (`src/rules/engine.ts`)
   - Hard rules evaluation:
     - Account age < 30 days + karma < 100 → FLAG
     - Email not verified + age < 7 days → FLAG
   - AI rules evaluation:
     - Dating intent >80% confidence → REMOVE
     - Scammer risk HIGH (>75% confidence) → FLAG
     - Appears underage >85% confidence → FLAG
   - Configurable thresholds per subreddit

4. **Implement Action Executors** (`src/actions/`)
   - FLAG: Report to mod queue with reason
   - REMOVE: Remove post + auto-comment explaining why
   - COMMENT: Add warning comment (dating-seeking behavior)
   - BAN: Manual override only (never auto-execute)

**Priority 3: Testing & Validation**
5. **Integration Testing**
   - Test with real users in playtest subreddit
   - Validate all three providers work
   - Test failover mechanism (Claude → OpenAI → DeepSeek)
   - Measure actual costs per analysis
   - Check for false positives/negatives

6. **Deploy to Test Subreddit**
   - Deploy updated app to r/AiAutomod
   - Monitor for 48 hours in FLAG-only mode
   - Collect metrics on accuracy
   - Refine confidence thresholds if needed

## The System Flow (How It Works)

```
User posts to r/FriendsOver40
  ↓
1. Check: Is user trusted? (Redis lookup)
   YES → Approve immediately, done ✅
   NO → Continue ↓

2. Check: Cached analysis? (last 24h)
   YES → Use cached result, skip to step 5
   NO → Continue ↓

3. Fetch user profile + post history (20 posts)
   - Account age, karma, email verified
   - Last 20 posts/comments from ALL subs
   - Cache both (24h TTL)

4. AI Analysis (if budget allows)
   - Check daily budget first
   - Send profile + history to OpenAI
   - AI checks:
     * Dating intent? (YES/NO + confidence)
     * Scammer patterns? (LOW/MED/HIGH + confidence)
     * Age estimate (for FriendsOver subs)
   - Cache AI result (24h TTL)
   - Track cost

5. Evaluate Rules
   Hard rules:
   - Account < 30 days + low karma + unverified → FLAG
   AI rules:
   - Dating intent >80% confidence → REMOVE + comment
   - Scammer risk HIGH >75% confidence → FLAG
   - Appears underage >85% confidence → FLAG

6. Execute Action
   - APPROVE (default if no rules match)
   - FLAG (report to mod queue)
   - REMOVE (remove + auto-comment)
   - BAN (manual override only)

7. Update Trust Score
   - Approved posts increase score
   - If score > 70 → mark as "trusted"

8. Log Everything
   - Action taken, reason, cost, AI analysis
```

## Important Decisions

### Architecture: User Profiling (Not Generic Rules)
**Why**: Actual need is analyzing new posters, not content moderation
**What**: Fetch user profile + history, analyze with AI, take action based on patterns

### AI: Multi-Provider Strategy (See docs/ai-provider-comparison.md)

**Primary Options** (testing required):
1. **Claude 3.5 Haiku** - Best quality, proven reliability (~$0.05-0.08/analysis)
2. **DeepSeek V3** - Lowest cost, testing needed (~$0.02-0.03/analysis)

**Fallback**: OpenAI GPT-4o Mini (~$0.10-0.12/analysis)

**Recommended Approach**:
- **Phase 2 Week 1**: Implement Claude + OpenAI + DeepSeek
- **Phase 2 Week 2**: A/B test all three with real data (200 users)
- **Decision**: Choose primary based on quality/cost balance

**Estimated Costs**:
- With Claude primary: $9-14/month
- With DeepSeek primary (if quality sufficient): $4-5/month
- With mixed approach: $6-10/month

**Cost Controls**:
- Daily budget limit (default $5/day across all providers)
- Aggressive caching (24h TTL)
- Trust score system (bypass AI for trusted users)
- Multi-provider strategy reduces dependency risk

### Trust Score: 0-100 Score to Reduce AI Costs
**Why**: Returning users with good history don't need re-analysis
**Factors**: Account age + karma + email verified + approved post history
**Threshold**: Score >70 = "trusted" (configurable)
**Benefit**: Saves ~50% on AI costs

### Start FLAG-Only, Transition to Auto-Actions
**Why**: Validate accuracy before auto-removing posts
**Plan**: Deploy with FLAG only, monitor for false positives, enable REMOVE after validation

## Cost Estimates

**Per User Analysis**:
- Profile fetch: FREE (Reddit API)
- History fetch (20 posts): FREE (Reddit API)
- **AI analysis (Claude 3.5 Haiku)**: ~1000 tokens × $0.00008 = **~$0.08**
- **AI analysis (OpenAI gpt-4o-mini)**: ~700 tokens × $0.00015 = **~$0.10** (fallback only)

**Monthly (3 subs, 20 posts/day) - Using Claude**:
- Base cost: 20 users/day × $0.08 = $1.60/day = $48/month
- With caching (50% hit rate): **~$24/month**
- With trust scores (bypass 30%): **~$17/month**
- **With both optimizations: ~$15/month**

**Fallback Costs**:
- If Claude unavailable and falling back to OpenAI: Add ~25% ($4-5/month)

**Budget Controls**:
- Daily limit: $5 (hard stop across all providers)
- Per-provider tracking
- Monthly aggregate
- Alert at 50%, 75%, 90% of daily budget
