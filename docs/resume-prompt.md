# Resume Prompt

## Quick Context
Reddit AI Automod is a Devvit-based moderation tool that uses AI (OpenAI + Gemini) to automate content moderation with both predetermined and custom rules. Built with TypeScript, Redis storage, and a hybrid two-stage AI strategy for cost efficiency.

**Stack**: Reddit Devvit (TypeScript), Redis, OpenAI API, Google Gemini API
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation & Setup (In Progress)

## Current State

**Status**: Phase 1 foundation complete, ready to implement event handlers and storage layer

**What Exists**:
- `/home/cdm/redditmod/CLAUDE.md` - Development best practices (local only, not in git)
- `/home/cdm/redditmod/.git/` - Git repository (6 commits: 5 on main, 1 Devvit structure)
- `/home/cdm/redditmod/.gitignore` - Comprehensive exclusion rules
- `/home/cdm/redditmod/README.md` - Project overview
- `/home/cdm/redditmod/package.json` - Devvit dependencies configured
- `/home/cdm/redditmod/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `/home/cdm/redditmod/devvit.yaml` - Devvit app configuration
- `/home/cdm/redditmod/node_modules/` - 403 packages installed (not in git)
- `/home/cdm/redditmod/docs/` - All planning documents + research/ subfolder
  - `predetermined-rules.md` - 20 pre-built moderation rules
  - `custom-rule-system.md` - Custom rule builder design
  - `architecture.md` - Complete technical architecture
  - `implementation-plan.md` - 6-phase development plan
  - `project-status.md` - Updated with Phase 1 progress
  - `resume-prompt.md` - This file

  - `types/` - Type definitions (empty, ready for implementation)
  - `utils/` - Utilities (empty, ready for implementation)
  - `config/` - Configuration (empty, ready for implementation)

**What Doesn't Exist Yet**:
- Test subreddit (needs creation)
- Reddit app credentials (needs registration)
- .env file for API keys (needs creation)
- Event handler implementations
- Redis storage layer implementation
- Type definitions
- Any actual moderation logic

---

## What's Next

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1 Continuation)
1. **Create test subreddit** - Private subreddit with < 200 members for beta testing
2. **Register Reddit app** - Get credentials at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
3. **Set up .env file** - Store API keys securely (OpenAI, Gemini, Reddit)
4. **Implement basic event handlers**:
   - `src/handlers/postSubmit.ts` - Handle new post submissions
   - `src/handlers/commentSubmit.ts` - Handle new comment submissions
5. **Create type definitions**:
   - `src/types/events.ts` - Reddit event types
   - `src/types/storage.ts` - Storage-related types
6. **Implement Redis storage layer**:
   - `src/storage/redis.ts` - Redis client wrapper
   - `src/storage/audit.ts` - Audit logging
7. **Test in playtest mode**: `npm run dev`
8. **Verify events trigger**: Check logs, test handlers work
9. **Commit Phase 1 completion**: Document and commit working foundation

### After Phase 1 Complete
1. Begin Phase 2: Rule Engine Core
2. Implement rule matching and evaluation logic
3. Create action execution layer

## Important Decisions

### Platform Choice
**Decision**: Reddit Devvit (TypeScript-based)
**Why**: Native integration, free hosting, built-in Redis, event-driven, eligible for $$ Reddit Developer Funds 2025

### AI Strategy
**Decision**: Hybrid two-stage approach
- **Stage 1**: OpenAI Moderation API (free forever, 85-90% accuracy)
- **Stage 2**: GPT-4/Gemini for edge cases (95%+ accuracy)
**Why**: Minimize costs ($0-50/month for 10k posts/day) while maintaining high accuracy

### Rule System
**Decision**: Both predetermined (20 rules) and custom rules
**Why**: Predetermined covers 80% of use cases; custom allows flexibility without coding

### Development Workflow
**Decision**: Follow 9-step mandatory workflow (Plan ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Document ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Report)
**Why**: Quality gates ensure production-ready code; documentation ensures session continuity

## Architecture Highlights

### System Components
1. **Event Handler Layer**: Receive Reddit events (PostSubmit, CommentSubmit, etc.)
2. **Rule Engine Core**: Match, evaluate, prioritize rules
3. **Content Analysis Layer**: Keywords, regex, links, user history, similarity
4. **AI Analysis Layer**: Provider router (OpenAI/Gemini), prompt templates, caching
5. **Action Execution Layer**: Remove, ban, comment, flair, report, approve
6. **Storage Layer**: Redis for rules, config, stats, cache, audit logs

### Data Flow
```
Reddit Event ‚Üí Event Handler ‚Üí Rule Engine ‚Üí Content Analysis ‚Üí AI Analysis (if needed) ‚Üí Action Execution ‚Üí Storage (logs, stats) ‚Üí Done
```

### Cost Optimization
- OpenAI Moderation API: Free (Stage 1)
- Prompt caching: 90% savings on system prompts
- Response caching: 80% reduction in AI calls (24h TTL)
- Batch processing: 50% discount when possible
- **Result**: $0-50/month for 10k posts/day

## Development Workflow Reminder

**MANDATORY 9-Step Process** (see CLAUDE.md for details):
1. **Plan & Design** - Break down task, use TodoWrite
2. **Implement** - Deploy specialized agent (NOT yourself!)
3. **Code Review** - Deploy code-reviewer agent
4. **Design Tests** - Deploy test-automator agent
5. **Run Tests** - Execute and verify pass
6. **Fix Issues** - Deploy debugger if needed
7. **Update Documentation** - Update project-status.md and resume-prompt.md
8. **Git Commit** - Commit after each task
9. **Report Status** - Inform user, update todos

**You are a project manager, not a coder!**

---

## Session Start Checklist

When starting a new session:
1. [ ] Read `./docs/resume-prompt.md` (this file)
2. [ ] Read `./docs/project-status.md` for current state
3. [ ] Review recent git commits (once repo exists)
4. [ ] Check CLAUDE.md for any workflow updates
5. [ ] Ask user what to work on (if not obvious)
6. [ ] Create TodoWrite list for the session
7. [ ] Follow the 9-step workflow for every task

---

## Important Notes

- **This is a moderation tool**: Prioritize accuracy and transparency over automation
- **False positives are worse than false negatives**: Better to miss violations than wrongly punish
- **Always provide appeal mechanisms**: Users must be able to contest automated actions
- **Keep moderators in the loop**: Notify of all significant actions
- **Document everything**: Future sessions depend on accurate documentation
- **Commit frequently**: After every task, not at end of session

---

## Next Session Should Start With

"I'm picking up work on the Reddit AI Automod project. Let me read the resume prompt and project status to understand where we are..."

Then:
1. Read this file (resume-prompt.md)
2. Read project-status.md
3. Ask user: "Ready to proceed with Phase 1, or do you want to review the planning documents first?"

---

**Status**: Planning complete ‚úÖ | Git repository initialized ‚úÖ
**Ready for**: User approval ‚Üí Phase 1 implementation
**Estimated time to MVP**: 6-8 weeks (5 phases)
