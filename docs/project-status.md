  - ✅ Updated postSubmit.ts (lines 186-203): Added field mapping based on action type
  - ✅ Updated commentSubmit.ts (lines 186-204): Same field mapping
  - ✅ Mapping logic:
    - comment: pipelineResult.action === 'COMMENT' ? pipelineResult.reason : undefined
    - removalReason: pipelineResult.action === 'REMOVE' ? pipelineResult.reason : undefined
    - reason: Used for FLAG actions
- [x] Testing and deployment - 2025-10-28

  - ✅ Verified COMMENT actions no longer failing

**Phase 5.11: Infinite Loop Fix - Bot Self-Detection (COMPLETE ✅ - 2025-10-28)**
- [x] Problem identification - 2025-10-28
  - ✅ Critical infinite loop on r/AiAutomod
  - ✅ Root cause: Bot processing its own COMMENT actions
  - ✅ Pattern: New user post → Bot comments → CommentSubmit processes bot comment → Bot comments again → loop
- [x] Implementation - Version 0.1.11 (partial fix) - 2025-10-28
  - ✅ Added getCurrentUser() API check to skip bot's own content

- [x] Initial fix (version 0.1.14) - 2025-10-28
  - ✅ Added 'ai-automod-app' to hardcoded checks
  - ✅ Now checks all three variations: 'ai-automod-app', 'aiautomodapp', 'AI-Automod-App'

**Phase 5.14: Community Trust System (COMPLETE ✅ - 2025-10-29)**
- [x] Problem identification - 2025-10-28
  - ✅ User reported: Global trust score bypasses community-specific rules
  - ✅ Root cause: High-karma veterans skip Layer 3 AI rules on first post
  - ✅ Impact: Romance scammers with old accounts bypass dating intent detection
  - ✅ Example: 10-year account, 50k karma posts "looking for romance" → skips all checks
- [x] Architecture design - 2025-10-28

**Phase 5.14: Reset Menu Item Approach (COMPLETE ✅ - 2025-10-29)**
- [x] Settings page 500 error fix (v0.1.19) - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ Fixed select field defaults: Changed from arrays to strings
  - ✅ Fixed 5 fields: commentAction, openaiModAction, primaryProvider, fallbackProvider, notificationRecipient
- [x] Reset toggle in settings attempts (v0.1.20-0.1.23) - 2025-10-29
  - ❌ Reset toggle didn't auto-reset after save (no onSettingsSave hook available)
  - ❌ Scheduler approach rejected by user
  - ❌ Two-flag system still required event trigger
  - ✅ Technical limitation discovered: No way to run code immediately after settings save
- [x] Menu item implementation (v0.1.24) - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ Removed resetCommunityTrust toggle from settings
  - ✅ Added "Reset Community Trust Scores" menu item (subreddit location, moderator-only)
  - ✅ Deletes trust:community:* and approved:tracking:* keys

  - ✅ Removed two-flag reset logic from postSubmit.ts (35 lines removed)
  - ✅ Removed two-flag reset logic from commentSubmit.ts (35 lines removed)
  - ✅ Provides immediate action with clear feedback

**Phase 5.15: Redis API Fix for Reset Menu (COMPLETE ✅ - 2025-10-29)**
- [x] Problem identification - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ User reported: "Clicking the reset scores menu gives '❌ Error resetting trust scores. Check logs for details.'"
  - ✅ Root cause: `TypeError: redis.keys is not a function` - Devvit Redis doesn't support `keys()` method
  - ✅ Devvit only supports: set, get, del, zAdd, zRange, zRem, hSet, hGet, hDel
- [x] Implementation (v0.1.25) - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ Implemented user tracking system using Redis sorted sets
  - ✅ Modified CommunityTrustManager to track users via zAdd() when updating trust
  - ✅ Modified main.tsx reset menu to use zRange() to iterate tracked users
  - ✅ Reset now deletes individual keys via del() instead of using keys()
  - ✅ User confirmed understanding of correct Redis API methods

**Phase 5.16: Infinite Loop Fix - Comment ID Tracking (COMPLETE ✅ - 2025-10-29)**
- [x] Problem identification - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ User reported: "I posted from cdm9002 to the sub, it looks like it is stuck in an infinite loop again"
  - ✅ Root cause: Bot was processing its own comments because getCurrentUser() returns developer account, not bot account
  - ✅ Two accounts: u/aiautomodapp (developer) and u/ai-automod-app (app bot)
  - ✅ Bot detection via username comparison wasn't working
- [x] Failed approaches (v0.1.26-0.1.28) - 2025-10-29
  - ❌ Case-insensitive username comparison - still looped
  - ❌ Hardcoded pattern matching rejected by user: "Do not hard code names in there"
- [x] Proper fix (v0.1.29) - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ Implemented comment ID tracking system
  - ✅ Modified executor.ts: Save comment ID to Redis with 1-minute expiration when posting
  - ✅ Modified commentSubmit.ts: Check if comment ID exists in Redis, skip if found
  - ✅ Self-cleaning (automatic expiration after 1 minute)
  - ✅ No hardcoded usernames or patterns
  - ✅ Works regardless of account structure

**Phase 5.17: Trust Score Update Logic Fix (COMPLETE ✅ - 2025-10-29)**
- [x] Problem identification - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ User asked: "Now, if I approve the post, do we pick that up and increase the score?"
  - ✅ Two problems discovered:
    1. COMMENT actions were incorrectly treated as REMOVE, immediately decreasing trust
    2. ModAction handler only handled removals, not approvals
- [x] Implementation (v0.1.30) - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ Fixed trust action mapping: COMMENT actions now return null (wait for mod decision)
  - ✅ Only APPROVE, FLAG, and REMOVE actions update trust scores
  - ✅ Added ModAction approval handling (approvelink, approvecomment)
  - ✅ When mod approves content, trust score increases
  - ✅ When mod removes content (with reason), trust score decreases
  - ✅ Updated both postSubmit.ts and commentSubmit.ts

**Phase 5.18: ModAction Event Structure Debug (COMPLETE ✅ - 2025-10-29)**
- [x] Problem identification - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ User tested approval: "I just approved a post as moderator, did we see the event?"
  - ✅ Log showed: `[ModAction] No modAction in event, skipping`
  - ✅ Event structure incorrect: accessing event.modAction.type but property doesn't exist
- [x] Initial fix attempt (v0.1.31) - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ User provided Reddit docs: https://developers.reddit.com/docs/api/redditapi/models/interfaces/ModAction
  - ✅ Changed event access from event.action to event.modAction.type
  - ✅ Still not working: event.modAction doesn't exist
- [x] Debug logging added (v0.1.32-v0.1.33) - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ Added console.log for Object.keys(event)
  - ✅ Added JSON.stringify(event) to see full structure
  - ✅ Captured actual approval event structure
- [x] Fix completed (v0.1.34) - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ Event structure is FLAT: `event.action` (not `event.modAction.type`)
  - ✅ Approvals working: Trust scores increase on mod approval
  - ✅ Removals detected: System checks for tracking records
  - ✅ Phase 5.18 COMPLETE

**Phase 5.19: Tracking Records & Removal Logic (COMPLETE ✅ - 2025-10-29)**
- [x] Logic flaw identified - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ User: "If mod approves then removes, trust should decrease (undo the approval)"
  - ✅ Problem: Manual mod approvals didn't create tracking records
  - ✅ Result: Mod removals couldn't undo manual approvals
- [x] Implementation (v0.1.35) - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ Modified modAction.ts to create tracking records for mod approvals
  - ✅ 24-hour TTL on tracking records (same as bot approvals)
  - ✅ Now ANY approval (bot or mod) can be undone if later removed
- [x] Removal reason requirement removed (v0.1.36) - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ User: "Change it so any mod removal affects score (no reason check)"
  - ✅ Rationale: Removals mean rule breaks/duplicates - always apply penalty
  - ✅ Removed 40 lines of removal reason checking code
  - ✅ Simplified logic: Tracking record exists → Apply penalty (always)
- [x] Testing and deployment - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ Version 0.1.35 deployed (tracking records for mod approvals)
  - ✅ Version 0.1.36 deployed (removal reason check removed)
  - ✅ Both versions installed to r/AiAutomod
  - ✅ Phase 5.19 COMPLETE

**Phase 5.20: Ultra-Concise Toast Format for "View AI Analysis" (COMPLETE ✅ - 2025-10-29)**
- [x] Problem identification - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ User reported: Toast display truncated to ~2 lines, can't show 10+ line formatted analysis
  - ✅ Screenshot showed: Only "AI Automod Analysis" and "Action:..." visible
  - ✅ Root cause: `formatAnalysis()` in src/ui/postAnalysis.ts created multi-line format unsuitable for toasts
- [x] User requirements - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ Format specification: "APPROVE 80/100. $0.0012 125ms. simple-rule."
  - ✅ Single line, ultra-compact, shows only critical info
  - ✅ Defer custom post UI (full-screen display) for later
- [x] Initial implementation (v0.1.37) - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ Deployed javascript-pro agent to refactor formatAnalysis()
  - ✅ Replaced multi-line format with single-line template
  - ✅ Format: `{ACTION} {trustScore}/100. ${cost} {time}ms. {ruleId}.`
  - ✅ Dry-run indicator appended when applicable: " (DRY-RUN)"
- [x] Code review and fixes - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ Deployed code-reviewer agent → identified 3 critical issues
  - ✅ Fixed execution time display: Handles "N/A" case properly (no "ms" suffix)
  - ✅ Fixed trust score type safety: Validates numeric type before display
  - ✅ Fixed redundant boolean conversion: Changed to `!!metadata.dryRun`
  - ✅ Updated format documentation to match actual output
- [x] Testing and deployment - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (no new errors)
  - ✅ Version 0.1.37 deployed to r/AiAutomod
  - ✅ Ready for user testing via "View AI Analysis" menu item
- [x] Example outputs:
  - ✅ Normal: `APPROVE 80/100. $0.0012 125ms. simple-rule.`
  - ✅ Dry-run: `REMOVE 45/100. $0.0023 235ms. spam-detection. (DRY-RUN)`
  - ✅ Missing values: `FLAG N/A/100. $0.00 N/A. default.`

**Phase 5.21: Separate OpenAI API Key for Layer 2 (COMPLETE ✅ - 2025-10-29)**
- [x] Problem identification - 2025-10-29
  - ✅ User discovered Layer 2 (OpenAI Moderation) required API key but showed error
  - ✅ OpenAI Moderation API is free but requires authentication

## Recent Decisions

### Platform Choice - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Use Reddit Devvit platform with TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Native Reddit integration
- Free hosting and Redis storage
- Event-driven architecture perfect for moderation
- Eligible for Reddit Developer Funds 2025
- No server management required

### AI Provider Strategy - 2025-10-26 (Updated)
**Decision**: Multi-provider approach with testing phase (see `docs/ai-provider-comparison.md`)

**Providers to Implement**:
1. **Claude 3.5 Haiku** - Best quality/reliability ($0.05-0.08/analysis)
2. **DeepSeek V3** - Lowest cost option ($0.02-0.03/analysis) - requires quality testing
3. **OpenAI GPT-4o Mini** - Proven fallback ($0.10-0.12/analysis)

**Testing Strategy** (Phase 2):
- Week 1: Implement all three providers
- Week 2: A/B test with 200 real users
- Compare quality, speed, cost
- Select primary provider based on results

**Rationale**:
- **Quality**: Claude proven best for nuanced content analysis
- **Cost**: DeepSeek could save 60-70% if quality acceptable
- **Reliability**: Multi-provider prevents single point of failure
- **Flexibility**: Can optimize based on actual performance data

**Expected Monthly Cost**:
- Claude primary: $9-14/month
- DeepSeek primary (if quality sufficient): $4-5/month
- Mixed strategy: $6-10/month

**Decision Point**: After 1 week of testing with real data

### Architecture Pivot - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: User profiling system instead of generic rule engine
**Rationale**:
- User's actual need: Analyze new posters in FriendsOver40/50/bitcointaxes
- Detect: romance scammers, dating seekers, underage users
- Simpler, more focused architecture
- Better aligns with real use case
- Easier to implement and test

### Trust Score System - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Implement trust scoring to reduce AI costs
**Rationale**:
- Users with high trust scores bypass expensive analysis
- Based on: account age, karma, email verified, approved post history
- Saves costs on returning users
- Improves performance (< 100ms for trusted users)

### Cost Tracking & Budget Limits - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Hard daily budget limits with tracking
**Rationale**:
- User requirement: monitor costs and prevent overruns
- Daily limit (default $5) enforced before AI calls
- Track per-call costs, daily totals, monthly aggregates
- Alert mods at 50%, 75%, 90% of budget

---

## Known Issues

### TypeScript Compilation Warnings
- **Issue**: Some TypeScript compilation errors when running `tsc --noEmit`
- **Impact**: Low - Devvit's build process is more lenient and runtime works correctly
- **Status**: Non-blocking, to be addressed in future refactoring
- **Workaround**: Using Devvit's build process instead of strict TypeScript checking

- **Documentation**: All planning docs need updating to reflect Phase 2 completion
- **Git**: 10 commits on main branch, pushed to GitHub (https://github.com/cdmackie/reddit-ai-automod)

### 2025-10-29 - Session 12 (Phase 5.28 - Dry-Run Mode Fix)
- User reported bug: Layer 3 rules showing "[DRY RUN]" despite global dry-run disabled
- Investigation revealed root cause: per-RuleSet `dryRunMode` field overriding global setting
  - Schema validator auto-added `dryRunMode: true` when field missing (lines 263-265)
  - Default rule sets hardcoded `dryRunMode: true` (defaults.ts:18, 29, 40)
  - Rules engine read from `ruleSet.dryRunMode` instead of global Settings UI
- **Fixed by removing per-RuleSet dry-run control** (v0.1.44):
  - ✅ Removed `dryRunMode: boolean` from RuleSet interface (types/rules.ts)
  - ✅ Removed auto-defaulting logic from schema validator (schemaValidator.ts:263-265)
  - ✅ Updated rules engine to use global setting: `const dryRunMode = (settings.dryRunMode as boolean) ?? true;` (engine.ts:93)
  - ✅ Removed `dryRunMode: true` from all default rule sets (defaults.ts)
  - ✅ Removed all references from storage layer (storage.ts)
  - ✅ Deleted `setDryRunMode()` method (no longer needed)
- Deployed javascript-pro agent for implementation
- Built and deployed successfully as **v0.1.44**
- Committed to git: commit e6e079e
- **Result**: Only global "Enable Dry-Run Mode" setting controls behavior now
- **User Impact**: Moderators can toggle dry-run via Settings UI without modifying rules JSON
- **Phase 5.28 COMPLETE** ✅
- User can now test Layer 3 Custom Rules with proper action execution

### 2025-10-29 - Session 12 (Phase 5.29 - Notification Format Improvements)
- User requested notification improvements:
  - Question: "is that the old rule dry run flag or the global flag?"
  - Request: Add user trust score to notifications
  - Request: Change "Rule Dry-Run" label to "Dry-Run"
  - Follow-up: Only show "Dry-Run: Yes" when enabled (hide when off)
- **Implemented notification improvements** (v0.1.45):
  - ✅ Added **Trust Score** display to notifications (shows user's current trust score %)
  - ✅ Renamed "Rule Dry-Run" to "Dry-Run" (clearer labeling)
  - ✅ Changed logic to only show "Dry-Run: Yes" when enabled (omit line when off)
  - ✅ Trust score appears after Confidence line in notification format
- Modified src/notifications/modmailDigest.ts (formatRealtimeMessage function)
- **New notification format**:
  ```
  Action: FLAG
  Target: Post t3_xxx
  User: u/username
  Reason: User is not single
  Confidence: 90%
  Trust Score: 45%    ← NEW (only if trustScore in metadata)
  AI Cost: $0.0003
  Matched Rule: xxx
  Dry-Run: Yes        ← Only shown when dry-run is ON
  Execution Time: 5ms
  ```
- Deployed javascript-pro agent for initial implementation
- Manual adjustment to change dry-run display logic (only show when true)
- Deployed successfully as **v0.1.45**
- Committed to git: commit 4d4fe91
- **Result**: Cleaner notifications with user trust score context
- **User Impact**: 
  - Moderators can see user's trust score directly in notifications
  - Less clutter when dry-run is off (normal operation)
  - "Dry-Run: Yes" warning is more prominent when testing
- **Phase 5.29 COMPLETE** ✅

### 2025-10-29 - Session 12 (Phase 5.30 - Trust Score Delta Logging)
- User requested trust score changes include delta in logs
  - Example format: "50% (+5%)" or "45% (-10%)"
- **Implemented trust score delta logging** (v0.1.46):
  - ✅ Updated `CommunityTrustManager.updateTrust()` to return `{ oldScore, newScore, delta }`
  - ✅ Updated `CommunityTrustManager.retroactiveRemoval()` to return score changes (or null)
  - ✅ Modified ModAction handler to capture and log score changes
  - ✅ Approval logs now show: "Trust score increased for user t2_xxx: 50.0% (+5.0%) after mod approval..."
  - ✅ Removal logs now show: "Trust score updated for user t2_xxx: 40.0% (-10.0%) after mod removal..."
- Modified files:
  - src/trust/communityTrustManager.ts (updated return types and calculations)
  - src/handlers/modAction.ts (capture return values and format logs)
- Deployed javascript-pro agent for implementation
- Deployed successfully as **v0.1.46**
- Committed to git: commit 7aa10df
- **Result**: Trust score changes are now clearly visible with before/after values and delta
- **User Impact**: Moderators can see exactly how their actions affect user trust scores
- **Phase 5.30 COMPLETE** ✅
