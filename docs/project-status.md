## In Progress

### Phase 1.2: User Profile Analysis (Next Up)
- [ ] Create `src/profile/fetcher.ts` - User profile fetcher
- [ ] Create `src/profile/historyAnalyzer.ts` - Post history analyzer
- [ ] Create `src/profile/trustScore.ts` - Trust score system
- [ ] Update PostSubmit handler to use new profiling system

---

## Blocked

_None currently_

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1.2 - User Profile System)
1. Build user profile fetcher
   - Fetch account age, karma, email verified status
   - Cache in Redis (24h TTL)
2. Build post history analyzer
   - Fetch last 20 posts/comments from ALL subreddits
   - Extract text, subreddit names, engagement metrics
   - Cache in Redis (24h TTL)
3. Implement trust score system
   - Calculate score (0-100) based on multiple factors
   - Store in Redis per user
   - Implement "trusted user" bypass logic
4. Test end-to-end profile fetching

### Next (Phase 2 - AI Integration)
1. Integrate OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini)
2. Create AI analysis prompts
3. Implement cost tracking system
4. Add daily budget enforcement
5. Cache AI analysis results

### Future Phases
1. Phase 3: Rules engine + action execution (FLAG, REMOVE, COMMENT, BAN)
2. Phase 4: Mod configuration UI + cost dashboard
3. Phase 5: Production deployment to 3 subreddits

## Recent Decisions

### Platform Choice - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Use Reddit Devvit platform with TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Native Reddit integration
- Free hosting and Redis storage
- Event-driven architecture perfect for moderation
- Eligible for Reddit Developer Funds 2025
- No server management required

### AI Provider Strategy - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: OpenAI gpt-4o-mini with cost tracking
**Rationale**:
- Cost-effective ($0.10 per analysis estimated)
- Structured JSON responses
- Good accuracy for our use case
- Daily budget limits prevent overruns
- Estimated monthly cost: $20-30

### Architecture Pivot - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: User profiling system instead of generic rule engine
**Rationale**:
- User's actual need: Analyze new posters in FriendsOver40/50/bitcointaxes
- Detect: romance scammers, dating seekers, underage users
- Simpler, more focused architecture
- Better aligns with real use case
- Easier to implement and test

### Trust Score System - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Implement trust scoring to reduce AI costs
**Rationale**:
- Users with high trust scores bypass expensive analysis
- Based on: account age, karma, email verified, approved post history
- Saves costs on returning users
- Improves performance (< 100ms for trusted users)

### Cost Tracking & Budget Limits - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Hard daily budget limits with tracking
**Rationale**:
- User requirement: monitor costs and prevent overruns
- Daily limit (default $5) enforced before AI calls
- Track per-call costs, daily totals, monthly aggregates
- Alert mods at 50%, 75%, 90% of budget

---

## Known Issues

### TypeScript Compilation Warnings
- **Issue**: Some TypeScript compilation errors when running `tsc --noEmit`
- **Impact**: Low - Devvit's build process is more lenient and runtime works correctly
- **Status**: Non-blocking, to be addressed in future refactoring
- **Workaround**: Using Devvit's build process instead of strict TypeScript checking

## Risks & Mitigations

### Current Risks

1. **AI Costs Higher Than Expected**
   - Status: Monitoring (not started yet)
   - Mitigation: Daily budget limits + aggressive caching
   - Plan: Can reduce analysis depth or frequency if needed

2. **False Positive Rate Too High**
   - Status: Unknown (not tested yet)
   - Mitigation: Start with FLAG-only mode
   - Plan: Refine prompts and confidence thresholds based on real data

3. **Reddit API Rate Limits**
   - Status: Low risk
   - Mitigation: Cache aggressively, respect rate limits
   - Plan: Exponential backoff if limits hit

4. **User Privacy Concerns**
   - Status: Low risk
   - Mitigation: Only analyze public Reddit data
   - Plan: Document what data is accessed and why
