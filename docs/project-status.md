## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2 - AI Integration) - READY TO START
1. Set up API credentials in environment:
   - Claude (Anthropic API key) - primary
   - OpenAI API key - fallback
2. Create AI provider abstraction layer
3. Implement Claude 3.5 Haiku client
4. Implement OpenAI gpt-4o-mini client (fallback)
5. Create AI analysis prompts (dating/scammer/age detection)
6. Implement cost tracking system (per-provider, daily/monthly totals)
7. Add daily budget enforcement ($5/day limit across all providers)
8. Cache AI analysis results (24h TTL)
9. Test AI analysis with real user profiles
10. Test fallback mechanism (Claude → OpenAI)

### Upcoming (Phase 3 - Rules Engine & Actions)
1. Define hard rules (account age, karma thresholds)
2. Define AI-based rules (dating intent, scammer patterns, age estimation)
3. Implement action executors (FLAG, REMOVE, COMMENT, BAN)
4. Add rule confidence thresholds
5. Test rules with real data

### Future Phases
1. Phase 4: Mod configuration UI + cost dashboard
2. Phase 5: Production deployment to 3 subreddits

## Recent Decisions

### Platform Choice - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Use Reddit Devvit platform with TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Native Reddit integration
- Free hosting and Redis storage
- Event-driven architecture perfect for moderation
- Eligible for Reddit Developer Funds 2025
- No server management required

### AI Provider Strategy - 2025-10-26 (Updated)
**Decision**: Multi-provider approach with testing phase (see `docs/ai-provider-comparison.md`)

**Providers to Implement**:
1. **Claude 3.5 Haiku** - Best quality/reliability ($0.05-0.08/analysis)
2. **DeepSeek V3** - Lowest cost option ($0.02-0.03/analysis) - requires quality testing
3. **OpenAI GPT-4o Mini** - Proven fallback ($0.10-0.12/analysis)

**Testing Strategy** (Phase 2):
- Week 1: Implement all three providers
- Week 2: A/B test with 200 real users
- Compare quality, speed, cost
- Select primary provider based on results

**Rationale**:
- **Quality**: Claude proven best for nuanced content analysis
- **Cost**: DeepSeek could save 60-70% if quality acceptable
- **Reliability**: Multi-provider prevents single point of failure
- **Flexibility**: Can optimize based on actual performance data

**Expected Monthly Cost**:
- Claude primary: $9-14/month
- DeepSeek primary (if quality sufficient): $4-5/month
- Mixed strategy: $6-10/month

**Decision Point**: After 1 week of testing with real data

### Architecture Pivot - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: User profiling system instead of generic rule engine
**Rationale**:
- User's actual need: Analyze new posters in FriendsOver40/50/bitcointaxes
- Detect: romance scammers, dating seekers, underage users
- Simpler, more focused architecture
- Better aligns with real use case
- Easier to implement and test

### Trust Score System - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Implement trust scoring to reduce AI costs
**Rationale**:
- Users with high trust scores bypass expensive analysis
- Based on: account age, karma, email verified, approved post history
- Saves costs on returning users
- Improves performance (< 100ms for trusted users)

### Cost Tracking & Budget Limits - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Hard daily budget limits with tracking
**Rationale**:
- User requirement: monitor costs and prevent overruns
- Daily limit (default $5) enforced before AI calls
- Track per-call costs, daily totals, monthly aggregates
- Alert mods at 50%, 75%, 90% of budget

---

## Known Issues

### TypeScript Compilation Warnings
- **Issue**: Some TypeScript compilation errors when running `tsc --noEmit`
- **Impact**: Low - Devvit's build process is more lenient and runtime works correctly
- **Status**: Non-blocking, to be addressed in future refactoring
- **Workaround**: Using Devvit's build process instead of strict TypeScript checking

## Risks & Mitigations

### Current Risks

1. **AI Costs Higher Than Expected**
   - Status: Monitoring (not started yet)
   - Mitigation: Daily budget limits + aggressive caching
   - Plan: Can reduce analysis depth or frequency if needed

2. **False Positive Rate Too High**
   - Status: Unknown (not tested yet)
   - Mitigation: Start with FLAG-only mode
   - Plan: Refine prompts and confidence thresholds based on real data

3. **Reddit API Rate Limits**
   - Status: Low risk
   - Mitigation: Cache aggressively, respect rate limits
   - Plan: Exponential backoff if limits hit

4. **User Privacy Concerns**
   - Status: Low risk
   - Mitigation: Only analyze public Reddit data
   - Plan: Document what data is accessed and why
