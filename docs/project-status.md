## In Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
- [ ] Create test subreddit (< 200 members) for beta testing
- [ ] Register Reddit app at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
- [ ] Set up environment variables for API keys
- [ ] Implement basic event handlers (PostSubmit, CommentSubmit)
- [ ] Set up Redis storage abstraction layer
- [ ] Create initial type definitions
- [ ] Deploy to test subreddit and verify events trigger

---

## Blocked

_None currently_

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1 Continuation)
1. Create test subreddit for development/testing
2. Register Reddit app and obtain credentials
3. Set up environment variables (.env file)
4. Implement basic event handlers:
   - PostSubmit handler
   - CommentSubmit handler
5. Create Redis storage abstraction layer
6. Define core TypeScript types
7. Test event handlers in playtest mode
8. Verify Redis storage works correctly

### After Phase 1 Complete
1. Begin Phase 2: Rule Engine Core
2. Implement rule matching logic
3. Create condition evaluator
4. Build action execution layer

## Recent Decisions

### Technology Stack - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Use Reddit Devvit platform with TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Native Reddit integration
- Free hosting and Redis storage
- Event-driven architecture perfect for moderation
- Eligible for Reddit Developer Funds 2025
- No server management required

### AI Provider Strategy - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Hybrid two-stage approach
**Stage 1**: OpenAI Moderation API (free, 85-90% accuracy)
**Stage 2**: OpenAI GPT-4 / Gemini (for edge cases, 95%+ accuracy)
**Rationale**:
- Minimize costs (Stage 1 is free forever)
- High accuracy when needed (Stage 2)
- Fallback/redundancy with multiple providers
- Estimated cost: $0-50/month for 10k posts/day

### Rule System Design - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Both predefined and custom rules
**Predefined**: 20 common moderation rules (spam, hate speech, etc.)
**Custom**: Full rule builder with UI for moderators
**Rationale**:
- Predefined rules cover 80% of use cases
- Custom rules allow community-specific needs
- Flexibility without requiring coding

### Git Strategy - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Exclude CLAUDE.md and research files from git
**Rationale**:
- CLAUDE.md is development workflow guide (local only)
- Research files are AI-generated reference docs (local only)
- Keep git repository clean with only essential project docs
- Dev meta files remain locally for assistant use

## Budget & Costs

### Estimated Monthly Costs (Production)
- **Devvit Hosting**: $0 (free)
- **Redis Storage**: $0 (included with Devvit)
- **OpenAI Moderation API**: $0 (free tier)
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API**: $0-30/month (with caching)
- **Google Gemini API**: $0-20/month (backup)
- **Total**: $0-50/month for 10,000 posts/day

### Development Costs
- **Time Investment**: 6-8 weeks (1 developer)

## Risks & Mitigations

### Current Risks
1. **Devvit Platform Limitations**
   - Status: Monitoring
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive research completed; no blockers identified

2. **AI API Costs**
   - Status: Low risk
   - Mitigation: Free tier + aggressive caching strategy

3. **Timeline Slippage**
   - Status: Medium risk
   - Mitigation: Phased approach; MVP first

## Team & Responsibilities

- **Project Manager**: AI Assistant (Claude)
- **Architect**: AI Assistant + specialized architect-reviewer agent
- **Developers**: Specialized implementation agents (python-pro, javascript-pro)
- **QA**: test-automator agent
- **Security**: security-auditor agent
- **Stakeholder**: User (project owner, final decision maker)
