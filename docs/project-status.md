## In Progress

_None currently - Phase 1 complete, awaiting direction for Phase 2_

---

## Blocked

_None currently_

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2: Rule Engine Core)
1. Design rule data structure and storage schema
2. Implement rule matching engine
3. Create condition evaluator (text matching, regex, AI triggers)
4. Build action execution layer (remove, flag, approve)
5. Implement priority and conflict resolution
6. Create basic rule testing framework
7. Test rule engine with predefined rules
8. Verify rule execution and audit logging

### Future Phases
1. Phase 3: AI Integration (OpenAI Moderation API + GPT-4/Gemini)
2. Phase 4: Implement 20 predetermined rules
3. Phase 5: Custom rule builder UI
4. Phase 6: Polish, testing, and public launch

## Recent Decisions

### Technology Stack - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Use Reddit Devvit platform with TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Native Reddit integration
- Free hosting and Redis storage
- Event-driven architecture perfect for moderation
- Eligible for Reddit Developer Funds 2025
- No server management required

### AI Provider Strategy - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Hybrid two-stage approach
**Stage 1**: OpenAI Moderation API (free, 85-90% accuracy)
**Stage 2**: OpenAI GPT-4 / Gemini (for edge cases, 95%+ accuracy)
**Rationale**:
- Minimize costs (Stage 1 is free forever)
- High accuracy when needed (Stage 2)
- Fallback/redundancy with multiple providers
- Estimated cost: $0-50/month for 10k posts/day

### Rule System Design - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Both predefined and custom rules
**Predefined**: 20 common moderation rules (spam, hate speech, etc.)
**Custom**: Full rule builder with UI for moderators
**Rationale**:
- Predefined rules cover 80% of use cases
- Custom rules allow community-specific needs
- Flexibility without requiring coding

### Git Strategy - 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Exclude CLAUDE.md and research files from git
**Rationale**:
- CLAUDE.md is development workflow guide (local only)
- Research files are AI-generated reference docs (local only)
- Keep git repository clean with only essential project docs
- Dev meta files remain locally for assistant use

---

## Known Issues

### Minor TypeScript Type Mismatches
- **Issue**: Some TypeScript compilation errors when running `tsc --noEmit`
- **Impact**: Low - Devvit's build process is more lenient and runtime works correctly
- **Status**: Non-blocking, to be addressed in future refactoring
- **Workaround**: Using Devvit's build process instead of strict TypeScript checking

---

## Budget & Costs

### Estimated Monthly Costs (Production)
- **Devvit Hosting**: $0 (free)
- **Redis Storage**: $0 (included with Devvit)
- **OpenAI Moderation API**: $0 (free tier)
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API**: $0-30/month (with caching)

## Risks & Mitigations

### Current Risks
1. **Devvit Platform Limitations**
   - Status: Monitoring
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive research completed; no blockers identified

2. **AI API Costs**
   - Status: Low risk
   - Mitigation: Free tier + aggressive caching strategy

3. **Timeline Slippage**
   - Status: Medium risk
   - Mitigation: Phased approach; MVP first

---

## Team & Responsibilities

- **Project Manager**: AI Assistant (Claude)
- **Architect**: AI Assistant + specialized architect-reviewer agent
- **Developers**: Specialized implementation agents (python-pro, javascript-pro)
- **QA**: test-automator agent
- **Security**: security-auditor agent
- **Stakeholder**: User (project owner, final decision maker)
