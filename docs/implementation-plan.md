## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Devvit platform limitations
- **Mitigation**: Research thoroughly before committing

- **Risk**: AI API costs exceed budget
- **Mitigation**: Aggressive caching, use free tier first

- **Risk**: Performance issues with large subreddits
- **Mitigation**: Load test early, optimize Redis queries

### Schedule Risks
- **Risk**: Features take longer than expected
- **Mitigation**: MVP first, add features incrementally

- **Risk**: Testing reveals major issues
- **Mitigation**: Test continuously, not just at end
