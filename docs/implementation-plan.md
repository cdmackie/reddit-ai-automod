# Implementation Plan - User Profiling & Analysis System

**Project**: Reddit AI Automod
**Platform**: Devvit (TypeScript)
**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25

---

## Overview

This implementation plan focuses on building an **intelligent user profiling system** that analyzes new posters to detect:
- Romance scammers (new/hacked accounts)
- Users seeking dating/hookups (Friends subs only)
- Underage users (Friends subs only)
- Spam/off-topic content (bitcointaxes)

**Target Subreddits**: r/FriendsOver40, r/FriendsOver50, r/bitcointaxes

**Approach**: Use AI to analyze user profiles and post history, combined with hard rules (account age, karma, email verification).

## Phase 3: Configurable Rules Engine & Actions (Week 3) - DESIGN COMPLETE âœ…

### Goals
- âœ… Build **fully configurable** rules system (no hardcoded rules)
- âœ… Implement hard rules with flexible conditions (account age, karma, email, content matching)
- âœ… Implement AI rules with **custom questions** (moderators write questions in natural language)
- âœ… Create action executors (FLAG, REMOVE, COMMENT)
- âœ… Add dry-run mode for testing
- âœ… Support text operators: `contains`, `not_contains`, `in`

### ðŸŽ¯ Critical Design Insight: Custom AI Questions

**Moderators write custom AI questions** instead of using hardcoded detection types:
- **Example**: "Does this user appear to be seeking dating or romantic connections?"
- **AI Response**: `{ answer: "YES"/"NO", confidence: 0-100, reasoning: "..." }`
- **Rule**: If answer == "YES" AND confidence >= 80% â†’ REMOVE

This makes the system truly flexible - moderators can define ANY detection without code changes.
