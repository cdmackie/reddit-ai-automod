## üéØ What It Does

Instead of waiting for bad actors to post harmful content, this app **proactively analyzes new users** when they make their first post or comment. It examines:

- **User Profile**: Account age, karma, email verification status
- **Post History**: Last 20 posts/comments from ALL subreddits
- **AI Analysis**: Custom questions you define (e.g., "Does this user appear to be seeking dates?")

Based on configurable rules, the app can:
- **FLAG**: Report to mod queue for human review
- **REMOVE**: Remove post and leave an explanatory comment
- **COMMENT**: Warn user without removing post
- **APPROVE**: Allow post (default for trusted users)

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è User Profiling & Trust Scoring
- Analyzes account age, karma (split by post/comment), email verification
- Fetches last 20 posts/comments from ALL subreddits (not just yours)
- Calculates 0-100 trust score to bypass expensive AI analysis for returning good users
- Caching system reduces API calls and costs (24-48h TTL)

### ü§ñ Multi-Provider AI Strategy
- **Primary**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (~$0.05-0.08/analysis) - Best quality
- **Secondary**: DeepSeek V3 (~$0.02-0.03/analysis) - Low-cost option
- **Fallback**: OpenAI GPT-4o Mini (~$0.10-0.12/analysis) - Proven reliability
- Automatic failover if provider is down (circuit breakers)
- Cost tracking with daily budget limits ($5/day default)

### üìã Configurable Rules System

**Two Rule Types**:

1. **HardRule**: Fast, deterministic checks (no AI needed)
   - Account age, karma thresholds
   - Post content matching (text, regex, URLs, domains)
   - Field comparisons (`<`, `>`, `==`, `contains`, `in`, etc.)

2. **AIRule**: Custom AI questions in natural language
   - You write the questions (e.g., "Is this user seeking romantic connections?")
   - AI answers: YES/NO/MAYBE with confidence 0-100
   - Set confidence thresholds (e.g., >80% = REMOVE, 60-80% = FLAG)

**Rule Features**:
- **Content Type Filtering**: Specify if rule applies to posts, comments, or both
- Priority-based execution (highest priority first)
- Nested AND/OR condition logic
- Variable substitution in messages (`{username}`, `{confidence}`, `{reason}`)
- Dry-run mode for safe testing
- Per-subreddit + global rules

### üí∞ Cost Control
- Daily budget limits with real-time tracking
- Per-provider cost monitoring
- Alerts at 50%, 75%, 90% of budget
- Aggressive caching (24h TTL for user analysis)
- Trust score system (skip AI for trusted users ‚Üí ~50% cost reduction)

**Estimated Costs**: $15-25/month for 3 subreddits (~20 new users/day)

### üîí Security & Privacy
- Only analyzes public Reddit data (no private info)
- PII sanitization before sending to AI (removes emails, phones, SSNs, credit cards)
- Redis injection prevention
- ReDoS protection in regex evaluation
- Field access whitelist (no arbitrary code execution)
- Complete audit logging with correlation IDs

## üéì How to Write Rules

### Example 1: HardRule - New Account with External Link

```json
{
  "id": "new-account-spam",
  "type": "hard",
  "priority": 100,
  "contentType": "submission",
  "conditions": {
    "operator": "AND",
    "conditions": [
      {
        "field": "profile.accountAgeDays",
        "operator": "<",
        "value": 7
      },
      {
        "field": "profile.totalKarma",
        "operator": "<",
        "value": 50
      },
      {
        "field": "currentPost.urls",
        "operator": "in",
        "value": [".*"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "action": "FLAG",
  "message": "New account ({profile.accountAgeDays} days old) posting links. Please review.",
  "notifyMods": true
}
```

### Example 2: AIRule - Dating Intent Detection (Posts Only)

```json
{
  "id": "dating-seeker",
  "type": "ai",
  "priority": 90,
  "contentType": "submission",
  "aiQuestions": [
    {
      "id": "dating-intent",
      "question": "Based on this user's post history, are they seeking romantic or dating connections? Answer YES if they mention dating, relationships, looking for partners, or romantic interest. Answer NO if they're just making friends platonically."
    }
  ],
  "conditions": {
    "field": "aiAnalysis.answers.dating-intent.answer",
    "operator": "==",
    "value": "YES"
  },
  "confidenceThreshold": 80,
  "action": "REMOVE",
  "message": "This subreddit is for platonic friendships only. Posts seeking romantic connections are not allowed.",
  "notifyMods": true
}
```

### Example 3: HardRule - Spam Links in Comments

```json
{
  "id": "comment-spam-links",
  "type": "hard",
  "priority": 95,
  "contentType": "comment",
  "conditions": {
    "operator": "AND",
    "conditions": [
      {
        "field": "profile.accountAgeDays",
        "operator": "<",
        "value": 3
      },
      {
        "field": "currentPost.urls",
        "operator": "in",
        "value": [".*"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "action": "REMOVE",
  "message": "New accounts cannot post links in comments. Please build karma first.",
  "notifyMods": false
}
```

### Content Type Field

The `contentType` field determines where a rule applies:
- `"submission"` or `"post"` - Only on posts (default if omitted)
- `"comment"` - Only on comments
- `"any"` - Both posts and comments

**Cost Optimization**: Use contentType to avoid expensive AI analysis on content you don't need to check. For example, if you only need to detect dating intent in posts, set `contentType: "submission"` to skip AI calls for comments entirely.

### Available Fields

**Profile Fields**:
- `profile.accountAgeDays` - Account age in days
- `profile.totalKarma` - Total karma (comment + post)
- `profile.commentKarma` - Comment karma only
- `profile.postKarma` - Post karma only
- `profile.isEmailVerified` - Email verification status
- `profile.hasPremium` - Reddit Premium status
- `profile.totalPosts` - Total posts across Reddit
- `profile.totalComments` - Total comments across Reddit
- `profile.subreddits` - Array of subreddit names user has posted in

- `currentPost.domains` - Array of domains extracted from URLs
- `currentPost.wordCount` - Number of words in title + body
- `currentPost.characterCount` - Number of characters

**Trust Score Fields**:
- `trustScore.score` - Trust score (0-100)
- `trustScore.isTrusted` - Boolean, true if score > threshold

**AI Analysis Fields** (only when AI rules are evaluated):
- `aiAnalysis.answers.{questionId}.answer` - AI's answer (YES/NO/MAYBE)
- `aiAnalysis.answers.{questionId}.confidence` - Confidence score (0-100)
- `aiAnalysis.answers.{questionId}.reasoning` - AI's explanation

### Operators

**Comparison**: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`
**Text**: `contains`, `contains_i` (case-insensitive), `regex`, `regex_i`
**Array**: `in` (checks if value matches any array element)
**Logical**: `AND`, `OR` (for nested conditions)

### Actions

- `APPROVE` - Allow post (skip remaining rules)
- `FLAG` - Report to mod queue for human review
- `REMOVE` - Remove post + leave auto-comment
- `COMMENT` - Add warning comment without removing

- ‚úÖ All tests passing (169/169)
- ‚úÖ Security audit (if handling credentials/user data)
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- ‚úÖ No console errors or warnings

### Git Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready code only
- Commit after **every completed task** (not at end of session)
- Descriptive commit messages: `<type>: <description>`
- Small, frequent commits preferred

### Testing
- Target: >80% code coverage (currently 90%+ on critical paths)
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for complete flows
- Security tests for injection/XSS/ReDoS
- Manual testing in private test subreddit

See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for complete development workflow.
