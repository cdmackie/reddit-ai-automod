## What It Does

Instead of waiting for bad actors to post harmful content, this app **proactively analyzes new users** when they make their first post or comment. It examines:

- **User Profile**: Account age, karma, email verification status
- **Post History**: Up to 200 posts/comments (100 posts + 100 comments) from ALL subreddits
- **AI Analysis**: Custom questions you define (e.g., "Does this user appear to be promoting a service?")

Based on configurable rules, the app can:
- **FLAG**: Report to mod queue for human review
- **REMOVE**: Remove post and leave an explanatory comment
- **COMMENT**: Warn user without removing post
- **APPROVE**: Allow post (default for trusted users)

---

## Key Features

**User Profiling & Trust Scoring**
- Analyzes account age, karma, email verification status
- Fetches up to 200 posts/comments (100 posts + 100 comments) from ALL subreddits (not just yours)
- Content sanitization reduces AI token usage by 40-60% (removes URLs, markdown, excessive whitespace)
- Calculates trust score (0-100) to bypass expensive AI analysis for returning good users
- Caching system reduces API calls and costs (24-48h TTL)

**AI-Powered Analysis**
- Works with Claude, DeepSeek, or OpenAI (automatic failover)
- You ask custom questions in plain English (e.g., "Is this user promoting a service?")
- AI answers YES/NO/MAYBE with confidence scores
- Set your own confidence thresholds for actions

**Flexible Rules System**
- **HardRules**: Fast, deterministic checks (account age, karma, links, keywords)
- **AIRules**: Custom AI questions with confidence thresholds
- Content type filtering (apply rules to posts, comments, or both)
- Priority-based execution
- Dry-run mode for safe testing

**Cost Control**
- Daily budget limits with real-time tracking
- Trust score system reduces costs by ~50% (skips AI for trusted users)
- Choose between premium (Claude) or budget (DeepSeek) AI providers

**Security & Privacy**
- Only analyzes public Reddit data (no private messages)
- PII sanitization before AI analysis (removes emails, phones, credit cards)
- Prevents injection attacks and malicious regex patterns
- Complete audit logging for every action taken

## Layer 3: Custom Rules + AI

Write custom moderation rules in JSON. Configure via Settings → Layer 3 - Custom Rules.

### Minimal Rule Format

#### AI Questions

Ask AI to analyze the user and their content:

```json
{

    "context": "This is FriendsOver40, platonic friendships only"  // Optional
  },
  "conditions": {

    "operator": "==",
    "value": "YES"
  },
  "action": "REMOVE"
}
```

**AI Field Access:**
- `ai.answer` → Current rule's AI answer (YES/NO/UNKNOWN)
- `ai.confidence` → Current rule's confidence (0-100)
- `ai.reasoning` → Current rule's reasoning text
- `ai.[other_id].answer` → Reference another rule's answer
- `ai.[other_id].confidence` → Reference another rule's confidence

**Combining Multiple AI Checks:**
```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "ai": { "question": "Is this dating content?" },
      "conditions": { "field": "ai.answer", "operator": "==", "value": "YES" },
      "action": "FLAG"
    },
    {
      "ai": { "question": "Does the user appear underage?" },
      "conditions": {
        "logicalOperator": "AND",
        "rules": [
          { "field": "ai.dating_content.answer", "operator": "==", "value": "YES" },
          { "field": "ai.answer", "operator": "==", "value": "YES" }
        ]
      },
      "action": "REMOVE"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Data Access & Privacy

### What We Can Access

**Public User Data:**
- Account age, karma, and email verification status
- **Public** post and comment history across Reddit (up to 200 items)
- Only publicly visible content that any Reddit user can see

**Site-Wide vs Subreddit-Scoped:**
- ✅ Accesses user's public activity from ALL subreddits (site-wide)
- Not limited to the subreddit where the app is installed
- This enables detecting behavior patterns across Reddit

### What We Cannot Access

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Private or hidden user profiles
- ❌ Deleted content
- ❌ Private messages or chats
- ❌ Restricted subreddit content (quarantined, private subs)
- ❌ Content the user has hidden from their profile

### Private Profile Handling

If a user has made their profile private:
- We **cannot** access their post/comment history
- We fall back to basic account metrics only (age, karma)
- The moderation decision uses limited data
- No AI analysis is performed (insufficient context)

**Privacy Note**: This app only accesses data that is already publicly visible on Reddit. We do not access any private information that wouldn't be visible to a regular Reddit user viewing the profile.

## Fetch Domains

The following domains are requested for this app:

- `api.anthropic.com` - Used for Claude 3.5 Haiku AI analysis of user profiles and post history to detect scammers, dating seekers, and problematic users (Devvit does not provide AI capabilities natively)
- `api.openai.com` - Used for OpenAI GPT-4o Mini AI analysis as fallback provider and for free content moderation via OpenAI Moderation API (Devvit does not provide AI capabilities natively)
- `api.x.ai` - Used for X.AI Grok AI analysis as OpenAI-compatible alternative provider (Devvit does not provide AI capabilities natively)
- `api.z.ai` - Used for Z.AI ChatGLM AI analysis as OpenAI-compatible alternative provider (Devvit does not provide AI capabilities natively)

## Configuration Notes

### Domain Approval Process

This app uses `devvit.json` (NOT `devvit.yaml`) for configuration. This is critical for domain approval:

- **✅ REQUIRED**: `devvit.json` with `permissions.http.domains` array
- **❌ DEPRECATED**: `devvit.yaml` with `http.fetch.allowList` does NOT trigger domain approval

When you upload the app with `devvit upload`, domains listed in `devvit.json` are automatically submitted to Reddit admins for review and will appear in the Developer Settings > Domain Exceptions section.
