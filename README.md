# Reddit AI Automod

> **Intelligent User Profiling & Moderation for Reddit Communities**

A Reddit Devvit app that uses AI to analyze new posters and detect problematic users before they cause harm. Built for moderators who want to protect their communities from romance scammers, dating seekers, underage users, and spammers.

## üéØ What It Does

Instead of waiting for bad actors to post harmful content, this app **proactively analyzes new users** when they make their first post. It examines:

- **User Profile**: Account age, karma, email verification status
- **Post History**: Last 20 posts/comments from ALL subreddits
- **AI Analysis**: Custom questions you define (e.g., "Does this user appear to be seeking dates?")

Based on configurable rules, the app can:
- **FLAG**: Report to mod queue for human review
- **REMOVE**: Remove post and leave an explanatory comment
- **COMMENT**: Warn user without removing post
- **APPROVE**: Allow post (default for trusted users)

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è User Profiling & Trust Scoring
- Analyzes account age, karma (split by post/comment), email verification
- Fetches last 20 posts/comments from ALL subreddits (not just yours)
- Calculates 0-100 trust score to bypass expensive AI analysis for returning good users
- Caching system reduces API calls and costs (24-48h TTL)

### ü§ñ Multi-Provider AI Strategy
- **Primary**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (~$0.05-0.08/analysis) - Best quality
- **Secondary**: DeepSeek V3 (~$0.02-0.03/analysis) - Low-cost option
- **Fallback**: OpenAI GPT-4o Mini (~$0.10-0.12/analysis) - Proven reliability
- Automatic failover if provider is down (circuit breakers)
- Cost tracking with daily budget limits ($5/day default)

### üìã Configurable Rules System

**Two Rule Types**:

1. **HardRule**: Fast, deterministic checks (no AI needed)
   - Account age, karma thresholds
   - Post content matching (text, regex, URLs, domains)
   - Field comparisons (`<`, `>`, `==`, `contains`, `in`, etc.)

2. **AIRule**: Custom AI questions in natural language
   - You write the questions (e.g., "Is this user seeking romantic connections?")
   - AI answers: YES/NO/MAYBE with confidence 0-100
   - Set confidence thresholds (e.g., >80% = REMOVE, 60-80% = FLAG)

**Rule Features**:
- Priority-based execution (highest priority first)
- Nested AND/OR condition logic
- Variable substitution in messages (`{username}`, `{confidence}`, `{reason}`)
- Dry-run mode for safe testing
- Per-subreddit + global rules

### üí∞ Cost Control
- Daily budget limits with real-time tracking
- Per-provider cost monitoring
- Alerts at 50%, 75%, 90% of budget
- Aggressive caching (24h TTL for user analysis)
- Trust score system (skip AI for trusted users ‚Üí ~50% cost reduction)

**Estimated Costs**: $15-25/month for 3 subreddits (~20 new users/day)

### üîí Security & Privacy
- Only analyzes public Reddit data (no private info)
- PII sanitization before sending to AI (removes emails, phones, SSNs, credit cards)
- Redis injection prevention
- ReDoS protection in regex evaluation
- Field access whitelist (no arbitrary code execution)
- Complete audit logging with correlation IDs

    }
  ],
  "conditions": {
    "field": "aiAnalysis.answers.dating-intent.answer",
    "operator": "==",
    "value": "YES"

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Platform**: Reddit Devvit (TypeScript)
- **Runtime**: Reddit-hosted (serverless)
- **Storage**: Redis (provided by Devvit, free)
- **AI Providers**: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek
- **Testing**: Jest (169 tests)

### System Flow

```
New post submitted
  ‚Üì
1. Trust Check: Is user trusted? (Redis lookup)
   YES ‚Üí Approve immediately ‚úÖ
   NO  ‚Üí Continue ‚Üì

2. Cache Check: Recent analysis? (last 24h)
   YES ‚Üí Use cached result, skip to step 5
   NO  ‚Üí Continue ‚Üì

3. Fetch Profile + History
   - Account age, karma, verification
   - Last 20 posts/comments (ALL subs)
   - Cache both (24h TTL)

4. Evaluate Rules (priority order)
   - Hard rules first (fast)
   - AI rules if needed (aggregate questions)
   - Call AI with all questions at once (batch efficiency)
   - Cache AI result (24h TTL)

5. Execute Action
   - APPROVE (default if no rules match)
   - FLAG (report to mod queue)
   - REMOVE (remove + comment)
   - COMMENT (warn user)

6. Update Trust Score
   - Approved posts increase score
   - If score > 70 ‚Üí mark as "trusted"

7. Audit Log
   - Action taken, reason, cost, execution time
```

### Default Rule Sets

**Included for Target Subreddits**:
- **r/FriendsOver40**: 6 rules (dating detection, scammer patterns, age verification)
- **r/FriendsOver50**: 5 rules (dating detection, scammer patterns, age verification)
- **r/bitcointaxes**: 4 rules (spam detection, off-topic filtering, low-effort posts)
- **Global**: 1 rule (new accounts with external links)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Practices

This project follows strict quality gates:

### Before Committing
- ‚úÖ Code review completed (code-reviewer agent)
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (169/169)
- ‚úÖ Security audit (if handling credentials/user data)
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- ‚úÖ No console errors or warnings

### Git Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready code only
- Commit after **every completed task** (not at end of session)
- Descriptive commit messages: `<type>: <description>`
- Small, frequent commits preferred

### Testing
- Target: >80% code coverage (currently 90%+ on critical paths)
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for complete flows
- Security tests for injection/XSS/ReDoS
- Manual testing in private test subreddit

See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for complete development workflow.
