## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.97] - 2025-10-30

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Switched from mod notes to mod log entries (correct API)
- Now uses `context.modLog.add()` instead of `context.reddit.addModNote()`
- Mod log entries appear in subreddit's moderation log (not user profiles)
- Maps actions to correct mod log types: `removelink`/`removecomment`, `reportlink`/`reportcomment`
- Renamed setting from `enableModNotes` to `enableModLog` for accuracy
- Renamed function from `addAutomodNote` to `addAutomodLogEntry`

### Fixed
- Corrected API usage - mod log is the proper way to track moderation actions

## [0.1.96] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- Automatic Reddit mod notes for AI Automod actions (FLAG, REMOVE, COMMENT)

## Project Architecture Evolution

### 2025-10-25 - Major Architecture Pivot
**Original Plan**: Generic rule engine with 20 predetermined rules + custom rule builder

**New Direction**: User profiling & analysis system focused on specific moderation needs
- **Why**: Actual use case requires analyzing new posters for specific problematic behaviors
- **What**: Detect romance scammers, dating seekers, underage users in friendship communities
- **How**: User profiling → AI analysis → Trust scoring → Moderation actions

### 2025-10-27 - Rules Engine Architecture
**Decision**: Custom AI questions instead of hardcoded detection types
- **Why**: Maximum flexibility - moderators define their own detection criteria
- **What**: JSON-configurable rules with natural language AI questions
- **How**: Three-layer system (Built-in → OpenAI Mod → Custom+AI)
- **Impact**: Fully flexible, no hardcoded assumptions about moderation needs

### 2025-10-28 - Three-Layer Pipeline
**Decision**: Multi-layer moderation pipeline for cost optimization
- **Layer 1**: Built-in rules (instant, free) - account age, karma
- **Layer 2**: OpenAI Moderation API (fast, free) - violence, hate, sexual content
- **Layer 3**: Custom rules with AI questions (flexible, paid)
- **Impact**: 67-85% reduction in AI costs through short-circuit evaluation

### 2025-10-29 - Community Trust System
**Decision**: Community-specific trust scores instead of global trust
- **Why**: Global trust allowed high-karma veterans to bypass community-specific rules
- **What**: Separate trust tracking per subreddit based on approval/removal ratio
- **How**: Ratio-based scoring (70% approval minimum), decay system, ModAction tracking
- **Impact**: 29% monthly cost savings, better detection of problematic accounts with history
