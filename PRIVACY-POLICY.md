Reddit user data is used ONLY for the following purposes:
- Analyzing user profiles to calculate trust scores

- Determining whether moderation actions should be taken based on your configuration

**Reddit user data is NEVER:**
- Stored or retained after analysis

- Sold or rented to anyone

### 2.2 Use of Moderator Configuration Data

Your configuration data is used to:

- Generate audit logs for your review
- Provide support and troubleshooting assistance

### 2.3 Sharing with Third-Party AI Services

When you configure the App to use third-party AI services (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek), Reddit user data may be sent to these services for analysis. Specifically:
- User profile information (username, karma, account age)
- Post and comment text content
- Any other data you configure to be analyzed

**IMPORTANT:** You are responsible for complying with the terms of service and privacy policies of any third-party AI services you choose to use. CoinsTax LLC is NOT responsible for how third-party AI services handle data. Before using the App, please review:
- Anthropic Privacy Policy: https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy
- OpenAI Privacy Policy: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

**Data Sanitization:** The App automatically removes certain personally identifiable information (PII) before sending data to AI services, including:
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Credit card numbers
- URLs (to reduce token usage and protect privacy)

However, this sanitization may not catch all PII. You acknowledge that there is a risk that PII could be sent to third-party AI services.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

All configuration data, including your API keys, settings, trust scores, and audit logs, are stored by Reddit on the Devvit platform. Reddit employs industry-standard security measures, including encryption at rest for sensitive data like API keys.

**We do NOT have control over Reddit's data storage or security practices.** Please refer to Reddit's Privacy Policy for more information.

### 3.2 Retention by Us

3. Contact us at support@coins.tax (though we do not store any data)

## 7. International Data Transfers

Reddit is based in the United States, and your use of the App involves the transfer of data to the United States.

### 7.3 EU/EEA Users

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If you believe you have CCPA rights that apply to our processing activities, please contact us at support@coins.tax.

1. Notify Reddit, Inc. immediately
2. Notify you via Reddit or email as soon as reasonably possible
3. Provide information about the breach and steps you should take
4. Cooperate with any investigation or remediation efforts
