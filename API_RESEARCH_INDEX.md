## Common Questions Answered

### Q: Is OpenAI Moderation API good enough?

**A**: For 95% of moderation needs, yes. It's free and catches most violations. Use Claude for edge cases.

### Q: Why Claude Haiku instead of other models?

**A**: Fastest (200-400ms), cheapest ($1/$5/M), best accuracy/cost ratio. Perfect for moderation.

### Q: How much do I save with caching?

**A**: 90% on the system prompt and rules. If using 1500-token system prompt, save ~1.35 tokens per request = ~$0.00135/request.

### Q: What about privacy?

**A**: Use paid tier APIs (data not used for training). For Reddit content, usernames are public but avoid sending emails/IPs to external APIs.

### Q: Can I self-host?

**A**: Yes, but requires infrastructure and engineering. Not recommended unless processing >100k requests/day.

### Q: How accurate is this?

**A**: 92-95% with proper tuning. False positive rate can be 2-5% with good thresholds. Human review queue catches edge cases.

### Q: What about latency?

**A**: OpenAI Moderation ~150ms, Claude Haiku ~300ms. Both acceptable for automated moderation.

### Q: Can I use open-source models?

**A**: Yes, but accuracy is lower (75-85%) and requires fine-tuning. Only cost-effective at massive scale.
